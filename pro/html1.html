        <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most
            recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex
            predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a
            solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements
            for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they
            become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.
            The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the
            east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early
            20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from
            Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and
            China. Today, the tiger's range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and
            tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra.
