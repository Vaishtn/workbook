        <h1>Tiger</h1>
        <p id="demo">
            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
            It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside.
            It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial
            and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its
            requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years,
            before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

    <h2>Life of tiger</h2>
    <p>
        The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east,
        and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century,
        tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and
        Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today, the
        tiger's range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on
        the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra.
